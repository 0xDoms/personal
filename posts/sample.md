## Why Use Next.js with Tailwind CSS?

Next.js and Tailwind CSS are a powerful combination for building fast and beautiful applications. With [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), you get the power of server-side rendering, static site generation, and dynamic routing. **Tailwind CSS** provides a utility-first approach to styling that makes it easy to create custom designs directly in your components.

### Setting Up a Basic Next.js App with Tailwind CSS

To get started, use the following commands to create your project and install Tailwind CSS:

```bash
npx create-next-app my-blog
cd my-blog
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

After running these commands, you’ll have a new Next.js app with Tailwind CSS ready to use!


```javascript
// Function to calculate sum of numbers in an array
function calculateSum(arr) {
    return arr.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
}

// Test the function
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log("Sum:", calculateSum(numbers)); // Output: Sum: 15
```
